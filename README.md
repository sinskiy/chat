# PERP?

I dislike using stack acronyms, but I didn't come up with a better name for this repo

- P - PostgreSQL
- E - Express
- R - React
- P - Prisma

Auth is currectly with JWT, but it's likely temporary.

# Usage

1. `cd backend && npm install`

2. `cd ../frontend && npm install`

3.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;
```

3. fill `server/.env` by `server/.env.example`
